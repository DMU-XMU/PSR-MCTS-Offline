USAGE
-----------------------------


Some combination of parameters might fail without warning, you have to know what you are doing...


Please run the following command.
./brl --ENV 12 --S 8 --A 7 --BAPOMCP --K 100 --T 20 --N 100


N is the number of runs.
=> Check main.cpp for all parameter names and configurations.


There is a lot of useless code in the source code, too late to change due to time constraints.
Only this algorithm and environment assurance can run.

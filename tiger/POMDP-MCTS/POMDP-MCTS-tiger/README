mkdir out
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..(may need to be executed twice)
make

USAGE
-----------------------------

Some combination of parameters might fail without warning, you have to know what you are doing...

Please run the following command.
./brl --ENV 11 --S 2 --A 3 --BAPOMCP --K 100 --T 20 --N 10000

K is the number of simulators.
N is the number of runs.
=> Check main.cpp for all parameter names and configurations.

There is a lot of useless code in the source code, too late to change due to time constraints.
Only this algorithm and environment assurance can run.
